## I/O package
The java.io package contains nearly every class you might ever need to perform input and output (I/O) in Java. All these streams represent an input source and an output destination. The stream in the java.io package supports many data such as primitives, object, localized characters, etc.


## Stream
A stream can be defined as a sequence of data. There are two kinds of Streams.
-**InPutStream** : The InputStream is used to read data from a source.
-**OutPutStream** : The OutputStream is used for writing data to a destination.


## Byte Streams
Java byte streams are used to perform input and output of 8-bit bytes. Though there are many classes related to byte streams but the most frequently used classes are, **FileInputStream** and **FileOutputStream**.


## Character Streams
Java Character streams are used to perform input and output for 16-bit unicode. Though there are many classes related to character streams but the most frequently used classes are, **FileReader** and **FileWriter**.


## Reading and Writing Files
Here is a hierarchy of classes to deal with Input and Output streams.
